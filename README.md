# Hello there!
This is one of my very first programs! It's a maze-solving program that take black and white images of mazes, where the maze's opening is to the left and the ending is to the right.

This was programmed with python and the pygame library, and includes 7 different mazes that the program can solve. You can choose each maze, and either see the program solve it or jump right to the solution (less fun).
